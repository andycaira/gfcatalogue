Throughout the years Griffin has used numerous different tags while graffiting. When they first moved to Boston they spent time tagging as **deLA**. As in "de la 607," not de L.A. During this period, they mostly made stickers and occasionally made smaller tags. It wasn't until **PROLE** when they hit their stride with graffiti writing. 

Obviously, it is not a graffiti writer's goal to take photos of all of their pieces so the records we have are very incomplete. Many of these have since been covered up or removed.
