This page is currently unfinished. Its just notes and placeholder text currently. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you to Michael Rocco. Without your support, many of these webpages would still be broken. 

Thank you to Aidan Nolan and Zoe Fenn for your help in documenting and collecting work. Thank you for approving my writing and designs and offerring feedback and for telling me I'm doing a good job.

Thank you to Sharon Honey Bunch.

Thank you to Victor Fisher.

Thank you to Duke Fisher for caring for Griffin's art and building a case for the more delicate pieces. 

And thank you to everyone else who has helped me along the way including Sam Kiss, Lin Vega, Emery Spooner, August Hlavacek, Sahil Patel, Nigel Gibson, Ian Downie, and many others. Griffin's love is still alive because of you.
