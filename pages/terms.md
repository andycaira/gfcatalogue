It was Griffin's intention to make all of their artwork accessible to people. Any image you see is downloadable and can be used, printed, painted over in any way you wish. You may make a print to hang on your wall, you may print it onto a t-shirt, you can put it on stickers and deface your neighborhood. You can cut them up and collage them. 

From Griffin:

>"All of my artwork, whether owned by individuals or in my possession, is entered in the public domain. Although some paintings and drawings I no longer have access to (as in other people possess) and I may not have images of, it was always my intention from the beginning that we try our best to document and digitally archive the things that Iâ€™ve made so that they could be shared freely to anyone."

We wish to uphold Griffin's wishes so this artowrk is yours, so to speak. But as purveryors and caretakers for Griffin's art and legacy we felt it was necessary to lay some ground rules, as even since the death of our beloved, the art world has changed in ways only they could have imagined.

These terms allow any individual, school, or organization use the images for any personal or educational use. These terms do not allow any *commercial* recreations, or any *commercial* merchandise to be made or sold. If there is a desire for some type of merchandise beyond any individual's personal capabilities feel free to email us at blankincorporated at gmail dot com.

These terms also strictly forbid any use of Griffin's art through an AI generator, any customized AI training or programming, and any NFT creation. We will not pursue this side of the art industry and will not allow these works to be used and sold as such. Please contact us at the email above if you discover any violations of this term. Thank you for understanding.
